Foreground is the whole box without words, dots or colour scale sphere. It also includes emotional properties text and line.

The green colour emotion text box is one which has already selected.
Yellow is unselected.
Try get the same colour text as setup images.

Sometimes people might select more than 4 emotions, maybe they could be scrollable
into transparency at box borders if more than 4, a bit like how the menu orbs go transparent(we will need to make a limit
of how many emotionns can be selected anyway on EL or how far the colour scale can move)

I made the boxes as single pngs but also as pngs with the dots.
You can choose yourself to use the ones with the dots or else put in the dots seperately
depending on how you want to code it.

The colour sphere should appear in position as saved from the EL just like in the Emotional History.

Instruction 1 comes up first time you use app skill.

Instruction 2 always comes up if you havent filled EL yet.

The questions box comes up when an emotion is tapped (selected)
It comes up to right of the emotions so you can quickly touch the next
emotion to fill out the next questions rather than closing and opening
everything over and again.

If you tap outside the question box it closes.

The questions can be scrolled up and down.

Tap a white box to enter text in it.

Everything saves automatically.

The calendar button opens up Emotional History calendar. You might need to stretch the
dark transparent background of emotional history assets to fit screen better depending on skill page
as it is without the grey borders from EL.

You will need to get all the questions off David, think there is only 4 or 5 of them?
