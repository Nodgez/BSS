Take a look at setup images to see how everything should be laid out.

Background: Try David's 3D half spherical idea , 
                      Otherwise it was supposed to just be a 2D image
                      that moves left and right, up and down, when you put
                      corresponding emotions by a certain degree and distance 
                      feels right.

Back/Next Buttons: these bring you to next or previous skill pages

Calendar Button: opens up calendar aka Emotional History Diary.

Cross: foreground at centre.

DiarySingleBox: See setup, it is the box where information of the
                           date and time and colour orb is saved. Not sure
                           how you will code this. Maybe have to make a map
                           of the image which selects a central colour  area 
                           from screen.
                           Notice how they become transparent behind frontal one
                           adn you can see an inkling of the next date behind it.

DiaryTransparentOverlay: When you press diary button this screen comes 
                                           up exactly like in Diary Setup image.

EmotionListBox: This is the box where the emotion list is.
                             David made out a list of emotions which is in this folder
                             It will be the same setup for the positive and emergency
                             emotions but on different side of screen for emergency 
                             emotions.
                             
EmotionListBoxIndicator: This scroll bar indicates how far up or down you 
                                            are in the EmotionListBox.

EmotionSingleBox:  When you select an emotion it appears directly on the 
                                 colour spectrum where the word position is selected like
                                 in the original beta app.
                                 This single small box appears behind the word to make the text 
                                 more visible over colour spectrum background.
                                 Might need to be stretched and scaled depending on length 
                                 of individual emotion text. (or a neutral size for all )

EmotionSingleBoxClearButton: Small subtle X button on EmotionSingleBox to
                                                    clear a selection.

Foreground: This is a png file with cut out centre circle at 0 opacity transparency so the 
                     colour spectrum can be put behind it and appear as a circle.
                     If we decide to go with the 3d version it should work like this too.

Instruction Arrows Left/Right : To be placed above instruction boxes.

Instructionbox 1,2,3: To appear first time someone uses app, then disappear,
                                   Possibly an option to turn them on again in about/help section
                                   of main menu. User testing will determine this need later.

InstructionBoxSingle: Just in case you want to put instruction text yourself
                                    at some stage.

MenuGUIButton: Brings you back to main menu orb selection straight away.
                             We are not using the menu idea from the wireframes anymore.
                             Just a simple button straight to main menu, because the
                             the arrow buttons let you skip between skills anyway.

OratorStd: This is the font for the Emotion lists and anything else.
                  Make sure the font is same colour as setup images.
                  Font will also be used for date and time in emotional history diary
                  and to display date on the Emotional history calendar button (top right
                  of EL) Again its just about getting the right colours for the font.
