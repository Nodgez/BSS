Think this is pretty straight forward with the setup images.

You can probably use the same grey transparent bacground from other scenes to save on image mb in the project. Same background and menu button and white line too. You can type Journal yourself or use the image text here.

You might want to use the complete entry tick in other skill text boxes such as strengths, positivity ratio, emotional properties etc.. have to see how they feel to use first i guess.
